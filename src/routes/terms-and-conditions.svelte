    you have booked last minute and there are less than 14 days before the date
    of the class, in which case no refund or exchange will be offered, but you

    days before the class, we will offer an alternative date or a 50% refund.

  </p>
  <h2>Wedding Ring Classes</h2>
  <br />

  <p>
    The rings: Whilst you will go away with two beautiful rings, please be aware
    that they may show some signs of being handmade, and will not be identical
    to those you can buy in high street jewellers that are made by machines-
    this is what makes the experience so special, as they will be totally unique
    and made with love.
  </p>
  <br />

  <p>
    Materials: Rings that are worn everyday will show signs of wear and tear no
    matter what they’re made of, but please make sure you have thought carefully
    about which materials make the most sense for you and your lifestyle- we are
    happy to advise. In the unlikely event that your ring breaks within one year
    of the class we will repair it free of charge, as long as this is not due to
    accidental damage or wear and tear (in which case we can quote you to
    repair). Sizing: We offer one free ring sizing service per ring made in our
    workshop, within 6 months. After that you will be charged at our usual rate.
    Timing: Please make sure you leave enough time between the class and your
    wedding, we recommend 6 weeks (8 for platinum rings). Please can you also
    confirm your chosen ring design at least 4 weeks before the class in order
    to ensure the correct materials are available. We may be able to do a last
    minute course but please be aware you may incur extra charges for a faster
    hallmarking service. If the class is last minute it may not be possible to
    add engraving or stones in time for the wedding. The class starts at 6pm and
    finishes at 9.30pm, if necessary your tutor will help you in order to make
    sure everyone gets home on time. Payment: There will be a £200 non
    refundable deposit on booking your class, the balance (£150) and the cost of
    the materials will be due 30 days before the class. If the payment is not
    made on time we may not be able to source your preferred materials due to
    metal manufacturing times but will offer you the closest available
    alternative. Problems: Any problems or issues you may have must be mentioned
    before you leave the workshop. Any additional work required will be charged
    at £40 per hour. Collection/Delivery: Once hallmarking and any additional
    work has been completed you may collect your rings from our Kings Heath shop
    any day of the week between 10am and 5pm. Alternatively you can pay for us
    to post your rings, we recommend Royal Mail tracked and insured services
    (from £6.80). Cancellation: If you wish to cancel within a month of the
    workshop the full workshop fee will be due. If you cancel before that date
    no more will be charged but you will lose the initial £200 deposit, you will
    be refunded for any materials. If we need to cancel for any reason you will
    receive an alternative date or a full refund, although we will not be held
    responsible for any other expenses incurred as a result of cancellation.
    Change of date: If you need to change the date and give us enough notice we
    will do our best to find a new date for you.
  </p>
  <h2>Jewellery Repairs</h2>
  <p>
    By leaving or sending your item it is understood that you are in agreement
    with our terms and conditions. Price: We will provide an initial estimate
    for the repair, and will wait for acceptance before starting any work. We
    will do our best to make you aware of potential problems but sometimes on
    starting the repair, unforeseen issues arise. If we realise that the repair
    cannot be completed within the agreed estimate we will notify you as soon as
    possible and wait for your confirmation to proceed. There is no obligation
    to proceed but there may be a charge for work already done should you
    decline. Turnaround: We normally have a two week turnaround for repairs, but
    some jobs, particularly those that require specialist materials or
    outsourcing may take longer, we will give you an estimated date when we take
    on the repair. If you have a preferred deadline for your repair please let
    us know when you leave your item of jewellery and we will do our best to
    accommodate you. We cannot be held responsible for any extension/delays
    caused by circumstances out of our control (for example delays from
    casters/platers etc.) Risks: We know how important your jewellery is to you,
    so we treat it as if it were our own family heirloom, but please remember
    that no repair is free of risk. There are times when parts or materials may
    break during repair due to wear and tear, we may be able to rectify this but
    if the jeweller was not at fault we will have to charge you for this and the
    repair may take longer than originally stated. Stones: Precious stones are
    particularly vulnerable during repairs due to their structure and existing
    and natural flaws, making them more susceptible to fracture, especially in
    the event of removal from setting or re-clawing. We cannot be held
    responsible for the replacement of any broken or damaged stones that occur
    with no fault to the jeweller. Metal: Some metals become brittle over time
    and may have undergone past plating treatment. We cannot be held responsible
    for any deterioration, discolouration that occurs following repair/finishing
    due to the condition of the metal and/or past treatment we have not been
    made aware of. Payment: Once we receive your confirmation to proceed with
    the quoted work, you are fully liable to make payment for the full work
    carried out and any additional materials quoted for, and items will only be
    returned to you upon full receipt of payment. Warranty: We offer a 6 month
    warranty from the date of completion on repairs unless otherwise stated. Any
    work carried out under the warranty period does not extend the original
    warranty given. Any warranty given on the repair will be limited to the
    exact repair and does not cover damage or deterioration caused by accident,
    misuse or mishandling. In the event of a fault covered by the warranty, we
    will repair or replace, at our discretion, any parts required and/or rectify
    the fault identified by the Jeweller. Removed materials: We reserve the
    right to keep or dispose of any materials which we have replaced – unless
    you have requested otherwise and explicitly agreed prior to proceeding.
    Unclaimed Repairs: We assume no responsibility for items not claimed within
    three months following the completion of the repair, and you acknowledge and
    agree that items not claimed within this timeframe may at our discretion be
    disposed of or sold without liability to the customer. Loss of Items: Whilst
    we make every endeavour to secure and protect any items left by you, you
    accept that any loss or damage that occurs to your item is at your own risk.
    All claims will be limited to the actual cost of repair or replacement and
    must be accompanied by an up-to-date valuation or original receipt.
    Satisfaction:You accept that you must reasonably inspect your item upon
    collection to ensure acceptable condition and satisfactory repair completed.
    We cannot be held responsible for any subsequent damage that occurs once
    your item has left our care. Collection/Delivery: You may collect your
    jewellery from our Kings Heath shop any day of the week between 10am and
    5pm. Alternatively you can pay for us to post your rings, we recommend Royal
    Mail tracked and insured services (from £6.80).

    enforceability of the other provisions of this privacy policy will not be
