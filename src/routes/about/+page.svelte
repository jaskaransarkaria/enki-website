    <h1>About</h1>
    <p class="about-shop">
      Enki is a unique gift shop and fully functioning jewellers workshop. We
      repair all types of jewellery onsite and also teach group and private
      jewellery workshops. The Kings Heath store shows the work of many
      independent crafts people who have become almost invisible on the high
      street today. From baby clothes to pottery, jewellery to cushions, we have
      just the gift you're looking for. <br /><br />We also sell beautiful and
      unique cards and wrapping paper to make your present that bit more
      special.
