    Make each others wedding rings, because itâ€™s more than just a band of gold
  </h1>
  <p>
    Learn a new skill and make the most important piece of jewellery you'll ever
    own. To make your wedding rings you will have the exclusive use of the
    workshop, soft and hot drinks and cake from the wonderful Early Bird Bakery
    next door. I will have the metal ready for you to make a practice ring in
    silver to get you acquainted with how it all works then you will go ahead in
    your chosen metal for the real thing! I will be guiding you all the way as
    much or as little as you like but whatever happens you will come out with
    two professional standard rings. After the class I will take them away to be
    hallmarked and will return them to you within two weeks. You can take away
    your silver samples at the end of the evening. If you aren't local I can
    give you lots of tips on where to stay and what to do in the area if you
    want to make a mini-break of it.
