    Got a necklace you're afraid to wear because the clasp sometimes fails? Got
    a ring you've loved for such a long time that the shank has worn away to
    nothing? We hate to see jewellery thrown away, bring it in and weâ€™ll get it
    back to it' former glory. We can even create a new partner for a lonely
    earring! Click here to get in touch.
